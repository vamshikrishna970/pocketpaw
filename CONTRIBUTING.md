# Contributing to PocketPaw

<!-- Updated: 2026-02-26 — Added "What we don't accept" section, tightened PR expectations. -->

PocketPaw is an open-source AI agent that runs locally and connects to Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, and a web dashboard. Python 3.11+, async everywhere, protocol-oriented.

We welcome contributions that solve real problems: bug fixes, new tools, channel adapters, tests, meaningful documentation improvements.

## What we don't accept

To keep the review queue healthy, we close PRs that fall into these categories:

- **Cosmetic-only changes** — whitespace fixes, comment rewording, reformatting code that already passes linting. If `ruff` is happy, we are too.
- **Trivial doc changes as standalone PRs** — fixing a single typo in README, renaming a variable in a code example, updating a link. These should be a comment on an issue or batched into a larger doc PR.
- **Unrelated changes bundled together** — a PR should do one thing. Don't sneak a README change into a bug fix. Split them.
- **PRs without a linked issue** — every PR needs a reason to exist. Open an issue first, even if it's brief. This lets us discuss the approach before you write code.
- **PRs targeting `main`** — these are auto-closed by our bot. See branch strategy below.
- **AI-generated PRs with no evidence of understanding** — if the PR description is generic or the author can't explain the change, we'll close it.

If you're new and want to contribute, check [`good first issue`](https://github.com/pocketpaw/pocketpaw/labels/good%20first%20issue) — those are real problems that need solving and are the best way to make a meaningful first contribution.

## Branch strategy

> **All pull requests must target the `dev` branch.**
>
> PRs opened against `main` will be closed. The `main` branch is updated only via merge from `dev` when a release is ready.

## Before you start

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/pocketpaw/pocketpaw/issues) to see if your bug or feature has already been reported.
- Check [open pull requests](https://github.com/pocketpaw/pocketpaw/pulls) to make sure someone isn't already working on the same thing.
- If an issue exists, comment on it to let others know you're picking it up.
- If no issue exists, open one first to discuss the approach before writing code.
- Issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/pocketpaw/pocketpaw/labels/good%20first%20issue) are a good starting point if you're new to the codebase.

## Setting up your environment

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork.
2. **Create a feature branch** off `dev`:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):
   ```bash
   uv sync --dev
   ```
4. **Install pre-commit hooks** (ruff lint/format on commit, tests on push):
   ```bash
   uv tool install pre-commit
   pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
   ```
5. **Run the app** to verify your setup:
   ```bash
   uv run pocketpaw
   ```
   The web dashboard should open at `http://localhost:8888`.

## Development commands

```bash
# Run the app (web dashboard)
uv run pocketpaw

# Run with auto-reload (watches *.py, *.html, *.js, *.css)
uv run pocketpaw --dev

# Run tests (skip e2e, they need Playwright browsers)
uv run pytest --ignore=tests/e2e

# Run E2E tests (requires one-time Playwright browser installation first)
# Install browsers: uv run playwright install (or .venv\Scripts\python -m playwright install on Windows)
uv run pytest tests/e2e/ -v

# Run a specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_bus.py -v

# Lint
uv run ruff check .

# Format
uv run ruff format .

# Type check
uv run mypy .

# Run pre-commit hooks manually (on all files)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Pre-commit hooks

This repo uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to catch issues before they hit CI:

**On commit** (fast, runs every time):
1. **ruff** - lints Python files and auto-fixes what it can
2. **ruff-format** - enforces consistent code formatting

**On push** (runs the full test suite before pushing):
3. **pytest** - runs all tests excluding E2E

If a hook fails, the action is blocked. Fix the issue and try again.

## Writing code

### Conventions

- **Async everywhere.** All agent, bus, memory, and tool interfaces are async.
- **Protocol-oriented.** Core interfaces (`AgentProtocol`, `ToolProtocol`, `MemoryStoreProtocol`, `BaseChannelAdapter`) are Python `Protocol` classes. Implement the protocol, don't subclass the concrete class.
- **Ruff config:** line-length 100, target Python 3.11, lint rules E/F/I/UP.
- **Lazy imports** for optional dependencies. Agent backends and tools with heavy deps are imported inside functions, not at module level.

### Adding a new tool

1. Create a file in `src/pocketpaw/tools/builtin/`.
2. Subclass `BaseTool` from `tools/protocol.py`.
3. Implement `name`, `description`, `parameters` (JSON Schema), and `execute(**params) -> str`.
4. Add the class to `tools/builtin/__init__.py` lazy imports.
5. Add the tool to the appropriate policy group in `tools/policy.py`.
6. Write tests.

### Adding a new channel adapter

1. Create a file in `src/pocketpaw/bus/adapters/`.
2. Extend `BaseChannelAdapter`.
3. Implement `_on_start()`, `_on_stop()`, and `send(message)`.
4. Use `self._publish_inbound()` to push incoming messages to the bus.
5. Add any new dependencies as optional extras in `pyproject.toml`.

### Security considerations

PocketPaw handles API keys, OAuth tokens, and shell execution. Keep these in mind:

- Never log or expose credentials. Use `credentials.py` for secret storage.
- New config fields that hold secrets must be added to the `SECRET_FIELDS` list in `credentials.py`.
- Shell-executing tools must respect the Guardian AI safety checks.
- New API endpoints need auth middleware.
- Test for injection patterns if your feature handles user input.
